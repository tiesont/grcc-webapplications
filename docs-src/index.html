## CIS

### Web Development

CIS-241 &amp; CIS-247 utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS) and it's Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) service to host a Linux 
web server virtual machine (VM) to which students deploy their code. This process can be tricky, so we've developed the 
following tutorials:

- [Setting Up an AWS EC2 LAMP Server](./setting-up-ec2-tutorial): a step-by-step guide to set up an EC2 instance, including setting 
up a custom domain.

- [Automated AWS EC2 Installation](./running-automated-ec2-script): a Bash script which can be run on an EC2 instance to automate the 
steps described in the _Setting Up an AWS EC2 LAMP Server_ tutorial.
